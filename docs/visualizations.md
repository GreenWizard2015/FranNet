# Visualizations

I've made an effort to explain and visualize everything in a clear and accessible manner. The materials below are presented in what I believe is the most user-friendly order for understanding. I have avoided technical details and focused on the visual aspect of the project.

- In [this note](visualize-note.md), you'll find brief technical explanations regarding visualization nuances.
- [Here](visualize-single-pass.md), you can find visualizations for the simplest restorator. The `single-pass restorator` attempts to restore an image in a single pass. The visualization demonstrates that it is not as straightforward as it may seem.
- [Here](visualize-diffusion.md), you'll find visualizations for the `diffusion restorator`. From a technical standpoint, this is the most complex model in the project. It utilizes intricate mathematical constructs and incorporates numerous implementation nuances.
